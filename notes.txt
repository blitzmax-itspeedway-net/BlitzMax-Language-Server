Send Message queue
TLanguageServer

    .send() identifies responses as those with an ID.. This is wrong it could be a request!
    .receiverthread() thinks missing methods are invalid, but they are really replies to our requests.

REQUEST TO CLIENT:
    id is SET
    method is SET

REPLY TO CLIENT
    ID is SET
    METHOD IS UNSET

NOTIFCATION
    ID IS UNSET
    METHOD IS SET

REQUEST FROM CLIENT
    ID is SET
    METHOD IS SET

RESPONSE FROM CLIENT
    ID is SET


client.sendmessage and client.logmessage are WRONG.
    - The LSP is sending not the client.. The client IS the IDE, think of it as remote.
    - The 

so first:
Upgrade TMESSAGE to contain a classifier: REQUEST, RESPONSE, NOTIFICATION Based on

            REQUEST     RESPONSE    NOTIFICATION
    ID      SET         SET         CLEAR
    METHOD  SET         CLEAR       SET

Next:
- Create a queue of outbound requests, tracking their request number so I can save Extra
  information in an object.
    For example, a workspace configuration would save the workspace in an EXTRA object
        The Request workdpne token, would save the task token so the progress bar can be updated.
- These requests must expire if there is no response in say... 5 minutes, to stop the queue from overloading.

Also SEND is just a high priority task... SHould we just add a send task to the task queue and get rid of the 
sendqueue?
